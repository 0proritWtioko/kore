Yet, unlike many of these products, it contains no hazardous aromatic hydrocarbons and is classified by EPA as RCRA non-hazardous for disposal purposes.
 
Milk out udder completely. Wash udder and teats thoroughly with warm water containing a suitable dairy disinfectant. Dry thoroughly. The hands of the operator should be washed and dried before the administration of each treatment. Using the alcohol pads that are provided with each syringe wipe off teat, using a separate pad for each teat. Appropriate sanitation and management procedures to prevent and/or control bovine mastitis should be instituted.
